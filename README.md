Telco customer analytics

Business problem:

Through this project, I want to identify the root causes for customer churn and predict it by machine learning.

Client:

My client, Telco Company, is a telephone and internet service provider with over 5000 customers. In order to grow and maintain profitability, itâ€™s essential that they learn how to maintain a dedicated customer base and reduce churn. Based on my analysis, Telco can :
Identify customers that are likely to churn and reach out to them to try to stop them from churning via special offers targeted to their needs
Focus marketing on customers that are more likely to be long term customers
Modify their services to improve the likelihood customers will stay longer term
